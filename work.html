            <h3>Systems Administrator Intern</h3>
            During the summer of 2023, I worked for the Airforce Civilian Service at Warner Robins Airforce Base. 
            I spent my time at Warner Robins learning about cyber security and helping protect the computers and other electronic devices on the base from malware and other cyber attacks.
            This included running security scans such as Nessus and S.C.A.P. to detect and fix any available exploits. 
            Although I was placed in an I.T. position, I found ways to use my knowledge of software engineering to make some of the repetitive processes automated. 
            For the Nessus scans, we had to first disable the Windows firewall and enable the built-in admin account. The other system admins were doing this by hand for every computer that they scanned. 
            So, I wrote a shell script to automate the prerequisites for these scans, which they are now using!
