            <h3>Air Force: Systems Administrator Intern</h3>
            During the summer of 2023, I worked for the Airforce Civilian Service at Warner Robins Airforce Base. 
            I spent my time at Warner Robins learning about cyber security and helping protect the computers and other electronic devices on the base from malware and other cyber attacks.
            This included running security scans such as Nessus and S.C.A.P. to detect and fix any available exploits. 
            Although I was placed in an I.T. position, I found ways to use my knowledge of software engineering to make some of the repetitive processes automated. 
            For the Nessus scans, we had to first disable the Windows firewall and enable the built-in admin account. The other system admins were doing this by hand for every computer that they scanned. 
            So, I wrote a shell script to automate the prerequisites for these scans, which they are now using!

            <h3>Association for Computing Machinery: Vice-President</h3>
            Being a part of the Association for Computing Machinery was my favorite experience from my time at Georgia Southern! 
            I loved branching out and getting to know people within my major. Not only was I a member since August of 2021, I was nominated as the vice-president of the club for the 2022 year. 
            This was a tough task for me to tackle. I was never the best at being social. However, I took on the role with pride and I am glad to say that I have grown a lot because of my role in ACM.  
            While I was coming out of my shell and becoming more social, I was tasked with introducing new concepts to my fellow students before they were taught in classes. 
            These concepts included programming languages, algorithms, and data structures. Along with teaching these concepts, I was helping members with the concepts they were currently learning in class. 
            I made myself available to the members of ACM in case they ever needed a tutor to help with any of their computer science homework. 
            Despite being a club focused on computer science, I wanted to expand the club so that the members got to know each other and became friends, we hosted multiple game nights to get to know everyone. 
            I am glad to say that I have met some of my best friends through these game nights!
