        <h2>Java Projects</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite Java project is my <a href="https://github.com/JensenBromm/Flappy-Bird-Game">Flappy Bird clone</a>

            <br>
            For this game, I used Java3D to model the pipes, the code for the pipes can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/JensenBromm/Flappy-Bird-Game/blob/main/src/mainPackage/Pipe.java">here.</a>
            <br>
            To simplify the code, I decided to only move the player up and down. The pipes are moving horizontally across the screen which gives the illusion of player movement.
            <br>
            Once the pipes are off-screen, they are then deleted from the game and recreated at a different position so that the game can loop indefinitely.

        <h2>Pyhton Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I have recently started to learn Pyhton. My starting project was making an app that allows you to download YouTube Videos.
