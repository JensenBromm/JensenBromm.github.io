        <!--Now Feature some of the projcets I have worked on-->
        <h2>Java Projects</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite Java project is my <a href="https://github.com/JensenBromm/Flappy-Bird-Game">Flappy Bird clone</a> 
            <br>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls muted>
               <source src="FlappyBirdGameplayDemo.mp4" type="video/mp4"> 
            </video>
            <br>
            For this game, I used Java3D to model the pipes, the code for the pipes can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/JensenBromm/Flappy-Bird-Game/blob/main/src/mainPackage/Pipe.java">here.</a>
            <br>
            To simplify the code, I decided to only move the player up and down. The pipes are moving horizontally across the screen which gives the illusion of player movement.
            <br>
            Once the pipes are off-screen, they are then deleted from the game and recreated at a different position so that the game can loop indefinitely.
        </p>
        <h2>Pyhton Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I have recently started to learn Pyhton. My starting project was making an app that allows you to <a href="https://github.com/JensenBromm/YoutubeDownloader">download YouTube Videos</a>.
            <br>

        <h2>Unity Project</h2>
        <p>
            During my Game Programming class, we were tasked with making our own game as a final project.<br>
            Here is my game <a href="https://github.com/JensenBromm/Universe-Revived-Unity-Game">Universe Revived</a>
            <br>
            <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DaOwBF6TSWsrVxht8cirO5Rqlww7dZMR/preview" width="320" height="240" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
            <br>
           After a semester of learning how to work with Unity, I was finally left to my own devices to make my own game starting from scratch.
           <br>
           The code that I am most proud of in this game is the enemies' FOV. If the player walks close enough to an enemy, the enemy will begin chasing the player. However, if the player sneaks up behind one of the skeletons, they will not be alerted until they are damaged.
